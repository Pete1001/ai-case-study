# A Case of Anthropic; where Claude excels

## Overview and Origin
* Anthropic
* Anthropic is a US based AI startup founded in 2021.  Anthropic is mostly known for its family of large language models (LLMs) named Claude.  Claude is a set of models which are competitors to other LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.
* Anthropic's founders are Italian American siblings Daniela and Dario Amodei.  Since its founding in 2021, the company has received significant funding of almost $7 billion from Google, Amazon, Menlo Ventures, Wisdom Ventures, Ripple Impact Investments and Factorial Funds.
* The idea of Anthropic came from the dissatisfaction with OpenAI's ventures with Microsoft.  Anthropic incorporated in Delaware as a public-benefit corporation (PBC) which requires it to satisfy a balance between public and private trust and governs the company to balance its interests between public and private benefit rather than simply profit.

## Business Activities
* Anthropic's LLMs Claude were developed to outperform other competitors such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.  One of the key features where it outperforms its competitors is the ability to analyze images.
* Anthropicâ€™s advantage in the market is a novel approach called Constitutional AI.  Constitutional AI is a feedback-based learning in two phases.  In the first phase called supervise learning, the model generates responses to prompts based on guiding principles, a so called constitution which is 75 points long and includes sections from the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  In the second phase, called reinforcement learning, generated responses are compared to compliance with the constitution of guiding principles.
* This unique approach of Constitutional AI gives the Claude LLMs the ability to respond appropriately to harmful requests without requiring human intervention.

## Landscape
* AI based research firm, based in San Francisco placing safety at the frontier of its products
* Constitutional AI is the largest innovation which is embedded in its LLM models such as Claude
* Competitors include OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft Copilot which seamlessly integrates into the Microsoft ecosystem of M365 products.

## Results
* The business impact of Anthropic's LLMs such as Claude is their commitment to "helpful, harmless and honest".  This approach allows Claude to put human safety guardrails around its models to allow for a more human approach.
* One of the success criteria, that Anthropic used to rate its GPT models is its ability to answer in a more human like way.  This was performed by proposing various ethical dilemmas where the GPT was asked to provide an answer.
* The results of these ethical trials were truly stunning where the human like approach.

## Recommendations
* Anthropic's GPT model is instructed to respond in ways that wouldn't offend a child in its Claude models.  I would recommend company creates a model for adults where all situations and responses are considered by the model.
* A true benefit would be a real, life-like scenarios.  For example, one of the examples sited regarding a situation where Claude is ask to make a decision of what to do when it is confronted with a situation where a robber, steals money from a bank and gives it to an orphanage.  In such situation, Cluse recommended not reporting the robber and discouraging him from committing it again.  This is great in a utopian society; however, in a society full of faulty sinful humans, a commitment to a rule of law is necessary to discourage others from such behaviors.
* The adult Claude model would simply remove the guard rails placed there as not to offend others and add additional Constitutional models that include rule of law, traffic rules, and other rules that govern our society such as The Constitution itself, FAA rules, all law precedents that were ruled by the Supreme Court, and other human rules.  Such as we don't eat rocks, glue, drink vile fluids, etc.
* This approach would make the model more realistic and would help avoid situations such as Google's AI recommending using glue on pizza or eating one rock per day.
